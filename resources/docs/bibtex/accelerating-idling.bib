abstract="We propose a technique called speculative lagging, which improves performance by dynamically adding periods of idle execution into the message-oriented system. The speculation is guided by a statistical model, which predicts context switches that benefit from delays. We analytically derive the expected speedup, which, for a fixed confidence, allows identifying lagging opportunities in O(1) time, without a performance overhead. We describe the corresponding speculation algorithm and use it to extend an existing scheduler. Comparison with other actor frameworks on standard benchmarks shows improvements of upÂ to 2.1                                                                                  {\$}{\$}{\backslash}times {\$}{\$}                  .",
